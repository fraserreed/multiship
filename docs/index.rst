Welcome to MultiShip's documentation!
=====================================

What is MultiShip?
------------------

MultiShip is a multi-carrier shipping library for PHP 5.3+.

If you have an application that supports multiple shipping carriers, MultiShip will make your life easy!
MultiShip allows you to retrieve rate quotes or create shipping labels from one or more shipping carrier
using the same simple, easy to read interface.  You don't have to worry about the intricacies of working
with individual shipping carrier APIs, MultiShip takes care of that for you!

With MultiShip you can:
 * Retrieve rate requests
 * Generate shipments and shipping labels
 * Track packages

MultiShip supports:
 * UPS
 * FedEx

Requests are made in a carrier agnostic format and responses are returned in a similarly agnostic format
for your application to consume.
